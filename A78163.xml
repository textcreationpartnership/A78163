         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen this ſmall treatiſe came firſt to my hands, it was only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd heap of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pieces without method, or imbelliſhment. I obtained it by communication of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lady, Illuſtrious for her
<pb facs="tcp:170183:4"/>birth, and very conſiderable in the eſteem of the more polite World, for her rare, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent qualities. She had kept it in her Cloſet as a concealed treaſure, to make uſe of in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions, which in time might offer themſelves. And doing me once the honor to demand my opinion of it, I preſently judged, after the peruſal of ſome few leaves, that it was the product of ſome great, and knowing Spirit; which after a thorough and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
<pb facs="tcp:170183:4"/>reading proved equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolid in all its parts, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to appear openly. I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took a reſolution to reduce it to ſome order, and cloath it in this form to publiſh it to the World.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely rich this ſubject is for the matter, how copious, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a field, and how often it hath been already manured, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed by many rare Pens with the greateſt art, and care, which might be capable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidate
<pb facs="tcp:170183:5"/>a more then ordinary courage. Nevertheleſs far from being ſtartled at the grand numbers of Writers, I thought I might go on without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, intending with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to tread in the ſame paths which thoſe eminent Wits had traced out before me.</p>
            <p>But that which prompted me the more eagerly, was the approbation of one of the moſt Heroick Cavaliers in the world, who by his excellent Vertues, his Noble Valour, and great
<pb facs="tcp:170183:5"/>Prudence hath filled all vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mens hearts with his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and admiration.</p>
            <p>His name ſhall live eternally with veneration in the world, norſhal the ſweet remembrance of his exquiſite parts ever pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh but with the laſt mortal man. His judgment is equally balanced betwixt delicacy and ſolidity, 'twere a ſign of temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or imbecility to oppoſe his ſentiments. 'Tis he in fine, that inſpired me with this ardour, and who by a cenſure very
<pb facs="tcp:170183:6"/>much to my advantage, hath diſſipated thoſe thick clouds, which the fear of envy, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſance might raiſe in a ſoul not truely generous. I am confident you will look on it favourably, both in reſpect towards him, and in conſideration of the end I have propoſed, which is no other, but the publick benefit, and eſpecially theirs, who do actually, or intend to exerciſe the like charges; who if they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take the pains to read it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to weigh it, and maturely
<pb facs="tcp:170183:6"/>conſider it; Will I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if they have that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which I ſuppoſe, infallibly find ſomewhat that ſhall profit them, in thoſe precepts, and that doctrine which it contains in a few ſheets, very neceſſary for the education, and conduct of the young Nobleſſe, and Gentry. This is the top of my ambition, and the whole bent of my deſires, to which there is nothing wanting, but to learn the name of this famous unknown Author, who firſt
<pb facs="tcp:170183:7"/>made the happy project. Not to enrich my ſelf with his ſpoils, but to publiſh his praiſes, as wel as his Writings, and to proteſt I am his admirer, and ſhall be his humble ſervant in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as I am to all the judicious, and courteous Readers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170183:10"/>through much labour. As likewiſe thoſe who are perſwaded, that it is a ſmooth Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet, where one may eaſily engrave all ſorts of Images; make no reflexion on the power of the temperature or conſtitution, nor of the need it hath of a commerce with the Sences, by which the ſpecies of all things are preſented to it. 'Tis a naked Tenant which comes to inhabit a furniſh'd Palace, where it finds the diſpoſitions, and the ſeeds of habits, which time, and exerciſe does afterwards bring to maturity. We carry the ſeeds of our good, or evill qualities in our veines, and the maſſe of our body, of it ſelfe inſenſible, does nevertheleſſe containe the originall of thoſe Sentiments, which the ſpirit vivifies. The intimate union wherewith the ſoule is knit unto it, and the need it hath of its Miniſtery, ought to teach it to entertaine it as a compagnon, and not like a ſlave. 'Tis brutiſhneſſe to abandon it to its appetites, and 'tis alſo a dangerous enterprize to teare them from it. That is the beſt period, to which by long and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb facs="tcp:170183:10"/>labours, a mature wiſdome can attaine, which time, and various fortunes does bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teach, then any diſcourſe poſſibly can. There are ſome Philoſophers ſo auſtere, that they will have an Angell in a man of fleſh, not conſidering him, but by what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes him from beaſts, without mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there are many things which are common to both; if he be rationall, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo animall, and his kind is no leſſe eſſential, then his difference. They will reduce this little Republicke into a Monarchy, wherof each part contributing to the labour, and merits, ought likewiſe to participate in the counſell, and the government.</p>
                  <p>If the aged appeare ſomtimes more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in their paſſions, then the youthfull; they owe this no leſſe to their bloud which growes chill, then to that experience, which illuminates them. Young people have a more puiſſant enemy to combate, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker weapons to make their aſſaults. Thoſe who conduct them, muſt by their prudence, imitate the wiſdome of brave Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb facs="tcp:170183:11"/>of Armies, who not willing to hazard a Battell, endeavour to ruine their enemies by cutting off all ſupplyes, and proviſions, dividing their forces, wearying out their ſouldiers by continuall alarmes, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely avoiding all their dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. He that ſhould ſtifly oppoſe their paſſions, which are ordinarily violent in their beginnings, would produce no other effect but an augmentation of their deſires, by raviſhing the meanes from them; and only make them become more ingenious to ſinne with ſubtilty and ſecrecy, not being permitted to doe it with impunity. The menaces, and puniſhments ordained for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, does make them indeed to be feared, but not hated. 'Tis a torrent pent in with banks, which breaks forth more impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as ſoone as it can force the leaſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and the effect ſubſiſting no longer then the cauſe; the vertue which proceeds from rigour, and conſtraint can never laſt longer then their feare continues. From thence alſo there ariſes a greater inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience:
<pb facs="tcp:170183:11"/>Which is, that the Sences finding themſelves too ill intreated, conſpire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to ſhake off the burthen, and make a revolt, which ſoone overwhelmes the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if it be weake, or cruelly agitates it if it makes reſiſtance. There is no man who is not indued with ſome graces, and a genius peculiar to his generation: But in ſtead of knowing and poliſhing them, wee often ſtifle thoſe naturall gifts, to acquire artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ones, which not being conformable to the ſubject, are like grafted Trees, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are long liv'd. Thoſe vertues that are forced into any one, both againſt the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and naturall inſtinct of the man, are like unto ſtranger Princes, whoſe Raignes are ſeldome peaceable, when they alter the Lawes of the Countrey. One muſt ſeeke to conforme with that good nature, which providence makes to ſhine in all its works, and without ſeeking other where for new plants, be content to cultinate diligently, and bring up thoſe, which nature hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready lodged in us.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:170183:12"/>
                  <p>This is that which he muſt carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, whom perſons of Honour doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in for the education of their children. Thoſe precious pawnes, in whom they, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſowed all their vertues, have alſo foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all their hopes in them. I doubt not but he will in ſo faire a ſubject find matter ample enough for an eaſie glory: and his care will be recompenced with advantage, by the humour which will reflect upon him, from thoſe illuſtrious actions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may one day ſignalize themſelves in the world. Nevertheleſſe, the fertility of the ſoile, muſt not make him neglect the culture; rather the goodneſſe of his nature ſhould make him uſe a more diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in his conduct. Myrtles and Lawrels are tenderer then Oakes, and more ſenſible of the rugged winter weather, and Roſes are ſooner parched then Thiſtles. Vertuous inclinations doe ordinarily bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on vices, and alwayes draw defects in traine after them: which hinders them not from being blame-worthy, although they
<pb facs="tcp:170183:12"/>be marks and tokens of vertue. Generous natures doe encline, and bias towards luxe and vanity: Tender and affectionate, to love and ſoftneſſe; the calme and tranquill, to negligence and ſloth: Active and fiery ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to levity and violence; the ſubtill, to ſleights and malice; and good natures, to ſimplicity and innocency. 'Tis no ſmall skill that muſt ſeparate the Cockle from the pure graine; becauſe the vertues created with us, are as was the world, before God had unravel'd the confuſion; where the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though enemies, lay mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their qualities, which make the harmony of the whole body, whoſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties makes us behold the viciſſitude of productions, accorded then together in one maſſe, which hid and conceal'd the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their beings. Even ſo before that reaſon has purified the qualities of our ſoules, we find vertues confounded together with vices, the ſpirit ſwimming in the bloud, and the Sences diſputing for maſtery with the will, untill time and the truth,
<pb facs="tcp:170183:13"/>comes to ſeperate this mixture, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes each party its devoir, function and ranke; before which, we can only aſſiſt it tenderly and beare with it.</p>

                  <p>COnſidering him then, as man compoſed of body and ſpirit, he by a prudent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration muſt endeavour to accord, as much as may be, the oppoſition of theſe two parts, and not reſt ſo much upon the purity of the one, but that he yeeld ſomthing to the infirmity of the other; to avoid that interior combat, which diſturbs the peace and tranquillity of our life. Which ſhould oblige him to become extreme carefull to know him throughly; to marke all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions, his motions, his averſions, and above all his genius, the ſtrength and extent of his ſpirit and mind. Foraſmuch as the
<pb facs="tcp:170183:13"/>knowledge of the winds, of compaſs, maps, and ſhelves, ſerves to a Pilot; and the skill of judging of the ſtrengths, and weakneſſe of a City is neceſſary to him that does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege it; So much does the art of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the diſpoſitions of a young ſpirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him in his directions. It is very difficult to aſſigne particular meanes, to make this obſervation, which depends rather upon the re-encounters, occaſions, and prudence of him that governes, then on any univerſall principles. Nevertheleſſe, I ſhall ſay in the groſſe, that he may remarke them, by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him diverſly with all kinds of objects, without diſcovering at firſt to him the good, or evill included in them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuffering nature to worke and act of her owne ſelfe, thereby to ſee what ſhe leads him to, and what ſhe makes him either chuſe or reject: Thus it was that <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> diſcovered <hi>Achilles</hi> his ſexe, which he had ſo long concealed and diſguiſed. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand occurrences reveale (to him that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly will obſerve it) what his temper is;
<pb facs="tcp:170183:14"/>which is likewiſe legible in his face, and may be gueſſed by his colour, maladies, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, his dreames, diſpoſition, and agility, and by all the operations of each part of his body: Alſo, by his reſentment of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the ſhame he hath for his faults, the care he takes to preſerve his honour, his deſire to appeare, his jealouſie of others, the heate and ardour which leads him to the ends he aimes at, his conſtancy and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in difficulties, the manner of his owne government, the vivacity and promptneſſe of his replies, and the ſtrength of his reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and arguments. On all which he muſt often try him, and raiſe his ſpirits by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull objects, to keep him in exerciſe, and ſee his activity. In that tender age we beare a forme of what ſhall be when we come to virility; Like thoſe Pictures, which being only rough-drawne, though they want that perfection and luſtre which the laſt colours adds to them, yet they have the perfect ſhape, and all the lineaments that are neceſſary. So that what the pencill
<pb facs="tcp:170183:14"/>afterwards does, ſerves only to embelliſh it, being ever wrought exactly by the ſame ſtroakes. Of all the precepts that can be given on this ſubject, uſe and cuſtome are the ſureſt guides and meanes, to penetrate and dive into the very bottomes, and moſt ſecret receſſes of thoſe young ſoules, who having as yet not learned the art to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, expoſe themſelves to any curious ſearch, and diſcover what their natures are by acting freely, and openly of themſelves.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170183:15"/>to the dimenſions of the ground-plot, and raiſe his edifice proportionably to his foundations. We have nothing, or but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little in us which may not be applyed to ſome good: All the works of God are good in themſelves, we doe make uſe even of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous beaſts for antidotes, and can extract a wholſome juice from the leaſt herb that growes. All our motions are of themſelves indifferent, they become good, or bad only by our meanes, and the uſe we make them ſerve for. Every one deſires good, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and that which cauſes ſo many to ſtray from it, is the different manner wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by 'tis repreſented: The will never tends to evill, but only when the ſpirit and ſences doe diſguiſe it under the appearance, and flattering ſhape of ſome good, and never erres but by the ignorance, or malice of its guides. Vertue is ſo amiable, that there is no ſoule which can know it, and not be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd with it, nor would vice be followed by any one, if it had not found out the art to counterfeit the other. The principall
<pb facs="tcp:170183:15"/>care conſiſts in well illuminating the mind and ſpirit, from whom the will takes all its counſell; that Miniſter muſt be well inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that he may faithfully informe his Maſter. The will is a Prince which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but is nevertheleſſe counſelled by his ſervants, the Orders and Edicts are made in his name, but his ſervants lay the plots and projects; 'tis he tends towards the objects, and applyes all the other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to ſeeke out what he deſires; but even thoſe which ſerve it in its purſuits, doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it in its deliberation. To theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould make his addreſſe, and when theſe are perſwaded, the other is eaſily drawne after them.</p>
                  <p>There are many which cauſe young men to exerciſe themſelves in vertuous actions with a kind of conſtraint, which makes them hate the end, even whilſt they are tending towards it. Although the Oxen draw the plow, yet the yoke is hatefull to them, and how ever we ſay that uſe makes perfectneſſe, and cuſtome renders the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:170183:16"/>difficult things eaſie: I beleeve that to be truer in actions of the body, then thoſe of the mind; whoſe eſſentiall liberty not being reſtrained but by ſome exteriour obſtacle: either it endeavours to ſurmount it by force, or at leaſt deteſts it, whilſt it does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe it. One is not vertuous for doing that which is good, but for loving it, and that which we doe by conſtraint, is only imputable to the power which compels us. The heavens are not animated though they inceſſantly move, their motion comming from a cauſe that's ſeparate, in their celerity we admire nothing but the Angels which firſt ſets them going. When vertue engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not in our hearts, but comes to us only from without, by ſome violent meanes, we poſſeſſe it only as a ſlave, who ſeekes but an occaſion to eſcape, and not as our offspring borne of our owne bloud and ſubſtance. 'Tis a beauty which will be ſought too, and wooed handſomely; that will command in us, and not be the ſervant of feare, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelfe only on thoſe whoſe hearts ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:170183:16"/>hath in full poſſeſſion. If once we can but inflame a ſoule with a true love for her, all the little troubles of ſeeking and courting her, will be ſwallowed up in the ardour of its longing deſires. One muſt endeavour therefore to render this vertue gratefull to him, by diſcovering all her perfection and amability, and heighten thoſe by the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of her oppoſite, making him admire in others the glorious effects which ſhe produces, and dread the ſhame, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which inevitably follow all baſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions; One muſt often highly praiſe the handſome qualities of thoſe he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, and as loudly blame the bad ones in his preſence; So furniſhing him from others, with good examples for himſelfe, which he will more clearly behold, then he can in his owne perſon. For every fault he ſhall commit, you muſt be ſure to make him reſſent ſome trouble in his mind, as ſhame, contempt, repentance, blame, the privation of ſome pleaſure, which being imprinted in his imagination, will make
<pb facs="tcp:170183:17"/>his actions become odious to him of its ſelfe: Whereas the puniſhments of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paſſe more lightly, and cauſe nothing but indignation, or at moſt a ſervile feare, which does not make him deteſt his fault, but only dread the evill which followes. There are a thouſand various means, which depend on the skill of him that ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch a charge, which cannot be reduced to precepts, conſiſting only in finding out ſweet, and cunning wayes to bring him to the deteſtation of vice, and a perfect love of vertue. This we may beſt bring to paſſe, by repreſenting it with pleaſing ornaments, advantages and circumſtances proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to his inclination: And this firſt view will beget delectation, from thence will ariſe love, which creates deſire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire will cauſe a diligent ſearch and purſuit after vertuous actions, which will beget ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits without difficulty, or paine. He muſt have the patience to lead him up by all theſe ſteps and degrees, for otherwiſe too great haſt may expoſe him to a fall, or at
<pb facs="tcp:170183:17"/>leaſt run him out of breath in the midſt of his race. He muſt alſo mixe, and temper his labours with ſome delights, and little complacencies, thereby to make him taſte and ſwallow the profitable and pleaſant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. As we uſe to gild over pils for ſicke perſons, ſo he may eaſily paſſe his ſtudies under his divertiſements, and make uſe of his owne paſtimes to inſtruct him; which will be farre more beneficiall to him, and not ſo ſoon diſtaſt him, as thoſe grand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of mind, which leave behind them nothing but laſſitude and vexation. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſtomack be a part which works neceſſarily, yet it cannot endure thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands which diſpleaſe it, much leſſe the mind which hath the liberty and choice of all things. In converſation one may even fill, and furniſh his ſoule with wholeſome things, and entertain him with ſolid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, delicately ſeaſoned, which deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhall yet ſoundly nouriſh him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the exerciſes of youth, one may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice him to ſuch, where the mind acts its
<pb facs="tcp:170183:18"/>part, where it aiguiſes and ſharpens, and refines its ſelfe, or to others which harden, fortifie, and ſtrengthen the body, making it become agile, active, and pliant to any uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exerciſe. And in ſo doing, one muſt without diſcovery, make him avoid thoſe that are childiſh, and ſuperfluous. When he is bent to any thing that is evill, or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, one muſt cunningly and ingenuouſly change that appetite, without directly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding, or flatly refuſing him, by interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome more pleaſing and ſolid objects, to divert his idea from that which is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him under other pretences; either by deferring, or by feigning to conſent to what he deſires, and contriving ſome obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle under hand which may hinder him, or permitting him ſometimes to make triall of it, but withall ſo diſpoſing of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, that he may receive ſome little diſpleaſure thereby; that ſo the injoiment it ſelf, of that which he unhandſomely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, may ſerve for a pennance, and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which cauſing a diſtaſte, will make
<pb facs="tcp:170183:18"/>him avoid the like another time; but ſhould one abſolutely refute him, and not practiſe theſe little contrivances, it would but irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and augment his deſire. 'Tis the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and obſervation of all wiſe men, that the will and deſire of man runs moſt greedily, and impetuouſly after forbidden things.</p>

                  <p>I Beleeve the trueſt reaſon of it is, that the Will will not loſe her right of liberty, it being the richeſt preſent ſhee brought from heaven with her. It may be likewiſe, becauſe wee fancy, and imagine there is more beauty and ſecret perfection, in the object that is kept at diſtance from us. As Pictures ſhew handſomer afar off, then neer at hand; or elſe even as thoſe things which we poſſeſs, do not tempt us; ſo thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:170183:19"/>which we have not, excite our deſire. A healthfull man, little minds his health, and learned men oft deſpiſe knowledge, (the full ſtomack loaths honie) whereas ſick, or ignorant people, would covet, and envy ſo much happineſs; and this happens becauſe the ſentiments require a certaine conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſtance to act, and that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, changes into our nature, and can no longer be the object of our appetite, but that which is at diſtance tempts us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. If it bee any thing eaſily attain'd and conquer'd, it does not ſtir up any violent motion, becauſe we do not fancy it ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and even eſteem it as good as our own already; being ſo facile to obtein. But if it be difficult and thorny, then it is that their iraſcible is moved, &amp; ſtoutly reſolves to paſs through all obſtacles. If it be the nature of the thing, that it be hard to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, hee only labours in the ſearch, and choice of means, without other trouble: But if thoſe impediments be in himſelfe, and that one forbids him to ſeek after that
<pb facs="tcp:170183:19"/>which he might eaſilie obtaine, then the conflict is greater, becauſe he has to deale with his own paſſions, which comming to ſummon all his ſtrength and forces, (as the natural heat againſt the outward cold) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends againſt his reaſon, and to overſway it, repreſents the forbidden object, with new and ſweeter charmes then was before ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. Let him bee carefull therefore in ſuch like occaſions, to temper his precepts judiciouſly, that the execution of them may not become troubleſome, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw him from thoſe evils in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he do not perceive the profitable conſtraint, which is put on him. If the ends hee tendeth towards, bee honeſt, but the means he uſes unhandſome, one muſt trace him other paths out to obtein them, and without either oppoſing or claſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his deſires, find out ſome other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet waies to ſtop, or hinder his miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. If his aims be evill, yet it is not the beſt way roughly to refuſe it, but rather reduce him to the neceſſity of not deſiring it any
<pb facs="tcp:170183:20"/>more, without ſuffering the loſſe of ſome more gratefull pleaſure. His paſſions muſt be ſet againſt his paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that ſo thoſe mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may deſtroy each other, and by their mutual oppoſition, make a perfect counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe, which may reſtrain, and tie them up in a juſt and equall temper. As a knowing Pilot makes every wind to ſerve his need, by turning his ſailes: So a skilfull man may apply al kinds of inclinations to ſome good. If he be carried to prodigality, one may moderate his too great profuſion, by the ſame principle, ſhewing him, that by waſting, or beſtowing too largely, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives himſelfe of the meanes, and pleaſure of giving often; and ſuffer him ſometimes to reduce himſelfe to the neceſſity of not having the meanes to do it, and at the ſame time, preſent ſome occaſions thereof to him, to tempt him to it, which will ſhew him, that the exceſs of his liberality, makes him incapable to continue it; ſo this incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhall make him reform himſelf, and this paſſion will deſtroy it ſelfe with its own weapons.</p>

The meanes, ſaies he, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect any of their exceſs; is to do actions that are contrary, or tending to a direct extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of oppoſition: And thus, ſaies he the ſoule will of it ſelfe return to that juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and mean, where vertue is placed; as a ſtick is made ſtreight by bowing and bending it the contrary way. But the uſe of this precept is dangerous, and requires great wiſdome, an accompliſh'd judgement, and an undaunted courage. Truly hee that ſhould treat young people thus, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to ſtrange conflicts, and perhaps their ſenſes thus ill uſed, might revolt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch tyrannie. It is good for ſuch as can, to practiſe it of themſelves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the violence which any one does to himſelfe, is never ſo ſenſible, as that which proceeds from another; But to exerciſe it on thoſe tender, and delicate bodies, would endanger breaking them, by bowing them ſo much. It is ſafer to prune, and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:170183:21"/>pare away the ſuperfluities, and lure the ſoule back, by ingenuous diverſions, yea, even by greater pleaſures, and delights, then thoſe we would deprive them of, or wean them from. If the youth will needs paſſe over a bog, do not hinder him, but lay a plank over it for him, that he may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and ſoil himſelfe: All this conſiſts only in the manner of managing things; and there is ſometimes more trouble in doing evill, then in doing good.</p>

If he can once but knit a ſtrict correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with his heart, he will eaſily become Maſter of his deſires, whereof that is the fountain. The heart is the Fort, or Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del which commands all the reſt of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle World Man. Whoever conquers but that place, ſuddenly brings the reſt into ſubjection; but though all the reſt were ſubdued, yet if that ſtood out, he hath but an exteriour puiſſance, which ſhall never make him rule as Soveraign, though he may ſometimes force him to complyance, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. That Woman had no ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that vaunted that ſhe govern'd the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Republick, becauſe ſhe entirely poſſeſſed her Husbands will, who bare the
<pb facs="tcp:170183:22"/>greateſt authority. 'Tis the heart preſides in the councel of our paſſions, and is that which produces all our deſires. In that lies the ſpring of all our motions, 'tis the repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitary of our ſecrets, the <hi>primum mobile</hi> of all our actions, the laſt aſleep, and firſt awake, all the affairs of man muſt paſs through this office; and though wiſdom, or reaſon do ſometimes a little reſtrain its power; yet the ſenſes are ever on its ſide, and being the head of a ſtrong faction, it may cauſe many huge troubles, if it be provoked and ſtirred by irritations. As ſoon as the eyes receive the ſpecies of any object, they are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately preſented to the heart by the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the mind hath no ſhare till after the other powers have taſted their fill. We muſt therefore firſt gain the heart if we will poſſeſs the whole man: by this means we ſhall not make him only delight, and eſteem things preſent to be good, but he will take pleaſure alſo to obſerve them. One may win ſomething by the power of perſwaſion on a ſoul; truth well expreſs'd does ever
<pb facs="tcp:170183:22"/>gain belief; but yet is not always followed. Words are but wind, as we uſe to ſay, they are only a ſound, which cannot enter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they find a paſſage ready open'd, but affection is a Character which penetrates through the heart, opens the door it ſelfe, and makes a deep impreſſion. 'Tis a Prince which obtains an Empire ſo much the more abſolute, by how much the obedience is more voluntary. It produces many good effects, in a perſon whom one governs: Firſt, it makes him plyant, and ſubmiſſive to all commands for fear of diſpleaſing, and ſo for the faults he ſhall happen to commit, there will need no other puniſhment, but only to teſtifie a little froideur, or coldneſs of affection. Even as God puniſhes the offences of thoſe he loves, by withdrawing part of his graces from them; that thereby their earneſt deſires to recover thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings a gain, may reduce them to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir again, and the fear of being deprived of them afterward may keep them ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for ever. Secondly, he will learn
<pb facs="tcp:170183:23"/>with far greater facility and eaſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoere ſhall be enjoined by a perſon whom he loves, becauſe the delectation will be joined to the utility. Love is a puiſſant Maſter, having ever both the attention, and aſſiduity of his Diſciples. The cauſe why young men learn with difficulty, is becauſe their heart is as 'twere divided and diverted by exteriour objects, they cannot ſo eaſily rally their forces which ſtray without, and which are neceſſary to digeſt the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is infuſed in them; but when their affection adheres, and cleaves to him that governs, they ſuck, and greedily ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all his precepts, and that amity which makes things become ſemblable, and alike, and the means proportionate, produces al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a certain communication of ſpecies, and conformity of manners, of ſentiments of language, and of actions. As one may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in all ſuch as do reciprocally affect one another. I beleeve the cauſe of it is, becauſe one does carefully obſerve the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe whom we wiſh well to; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:170183:23"/>we always think them noble, and thus conſidering them with ſome delight, they imprint themſelves inſenſibly within us. Or elſe it is, becauſe we frequent them oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that conſtant ſociety, does beget a conformity of habits; or in fine, becauſe the will does of it ſelf go forth, to joyn with the thing beloved, and even be transformed into it. In the third place, this affection will greatly incite, and prompt the young man to pleaſe him, to hear him, to beleeve and imitate him. The power of God muſt in the firſt place, reign moſt ſoveraignly, and abſolutely over men: and in the next place that of Parents, and laſt of all the power and authority of thoſe, who have the care and charge of our education, who are the fathers, as I may fitly call them, of our minds. 'Tis God is the firſt cauſe of our being, to which our Parents do contribute afterwards; bringing as 'twere the groſſer materials, which being ſet up in a natural frame, are afterwards adorned, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe our Tutors. And theſe muſt
<pb facs="tcp:170183:24"/>imitate God in all his conduct, ſince they immediately ſucceed him in his authority; Now the firſt thing God requires of men, is the heart; when we have given up, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſubmitted that part to him, we find no more repugnance, or reluctancy in our obedience, whereas thoſe who have no other object but the fear of puniſhments, or the hope of rewards, ſeldome attain to any high perfection. It is the ſame in moral things, if he that teaches them do not make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beloved, he will be followed but cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: when we would obtain any thing from a great perſon, we make uſe of ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Advocate to mediate for us. The mind and will are abſolute Monarchs, and will have us obſerve the ſame circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ceremony towards them. And the art of pleaſing is a powerful motive to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, and impetrate.</p>

                  <p>HE muſt nevertheleſs mannage this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs cautiouſly, and warily, leſt he confound his reſpect with his tenderneſs, or loſe his authority of reprehenſion by too much complaiſance; 'Tis a great art to know how to accommodate love with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and join ſeverity with ſweetneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out too much ſoftneſs. Amity requires a certain proportion which may oblige one to deſcend ſometimes to youthful Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which muſt be practiſed in ſuch a manner, that they by degrees be elbow'd out, and manly ones implanted in their ſtead. When the Poets make <hi>Iupiter</hi> transform'd into a Bull, or the like, to communicate himſelf to his lovers, they yet always leave ſome marks &amp; foot-ſteps of his divinity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe ſhapes. When Painters make the portraicture of any one in ſmall, they have
<pb facs="tcp:170183:25"/>a care to keep all the dimenſions proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the face, and body they mean to repreſent, though in a far leſs volume. And when God himſelf, through his immortal goodneſs was pleaſed to give himſelf to men, and illuminate them with his own brightneſs, which was before wrapt up in ſuch thick Clouds; knowing they were but children whom he would inſtruct, and whom the Father had committed to his educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he would not appear in lightning and thunders, nor in the luſtre of his greatneſs, which would have dazled and blinded them, in ſtead of enlightning them; but he became like unto them, and made himſelf ſenſible, that he might enter into their ſpirits by their ſenſes, and yet his divinity kept its grandeur, and ful majeſty, in this loweſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, &amp; abaſement. Governours of young men, are Gods Lievtenants in this functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as he became man, to teach men, ſo they muſt in ſome, ſort imitate Children, whileſt they inſtruct them, alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating themſelves to their age,
<pb facs="tcp:170183:25"/>ſometimes ſoothing their humours, and ſtooping to them, but having ſtill an eye and ear to make them reap ſome benefit from all their actions, and thoughts, ever raiſing their minds inſenſibly to higher things, and making their own ſentiments the ſtaires whereby they muſt climb up to true perfection. But yet he muſt not loſe his authority by this complyance. When a man will take ſome great burthen on his back, he ſtoops to take it, and then he not onely raiſes himſelf again, but bears up the weight that is laid on; In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ought he to appropriate and fit himſelf to his charge, and preſently when he is eſtabliſhed, and become abſolute Maſter of his mind, and will, he muſt advance to his own poſture again, and raiſe the youth up with him to higher, and nobler things.</p>
                  <p>'Tis an old Proverb, that familiarity breeds contempt; and 'tis alſo a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain experience, that gravity takes off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and affection.

                  </head>
                  <p>THere are three things which hinder one from preſerving amity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in a young ſpirit. The one comes from without, when the Tutor is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, and eſteemed by the Parents, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks, Friends, or compagnons of him he governs. Examples are a living Book, whoſe Characters eaſily imprint themſelvs in him that reads them. Exterior things are very powerful on any ſoul, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb facs="tcp:170183:26"/>on thoſe who as yet do not act but by the counſel of their ſenſes, who having not yet their own ſentiments fully perfected in them, are conſtrained to rely on the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others in whom they confide. The ſecond hinderance proceeds from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination of youth, who being promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their own pleaſures, abhor, and deteſt all that reſtrain, or impede them; which makes them look on their Governors, as the diſturbers of their repoſe, and enemies of their delights and ſenſualities, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately breeds averſion in them. And this is the more difficult to overcome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is more natural, and youth is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and conducted at firſt meerly by nature, who bandies againſt all that is oppoſed to her. That which cauſes diſtempers, and maladies in the body is the contrariety of ſuch qualities which are incompatible, and this alſo works the ſame effects in our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and produces love, or hatred, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the objects are conformable, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its propenſions. He muſt ſtudy
<pb facs="tcp:170183:27"/>therefore to overcome this obſtacle, and not have nature for his enemy at the firſt. But make a diſſembled agreement with her, to deceive her with the more advantage. The third proceeds from the Governor himſelf, when either by indecent actions, or vicious habits, he loſes the authority annexed to his charge, by ſuch defects in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. There is no better Art whereby to gain eſteem, then to become worthy of ſuch eſteem; Reſpect is a tribute which vertue commands, and acquires even from thoſe that hate it. Thoſe that poſſeſs it need uſe no Arts, nor falſe Grimaces, ſhe always keeps her own Majeſty, and is revered by the greateſt powers, though ſhe cannot make her ſelf be always beloved. Let him be careful therefore to deſerve honor, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, rather then to exact it. If he will bring theſe fruits forth in his diſciple, he muſt have the root of it to grow within himſelf. The honour of a Prince, if foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only in the number, and ſtrength of his guards, is but a vain appearance in his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb facs="tcp:170183:27"/>and as ſuch an one hath no true Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, but only a few outward pomps, and gawdy ſhows, ſo neither is he truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, or obſerved, but onely with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation of ſeeming devoirs, and flattering outward geſtures. That Tutor who hath no gravity but in his words, and threats, gaines no more obedience, then his diſciple is capable of fear. If he do any ignoble acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he pulls down all that his diſcourſe, or teaching had built, and even tempts, and invites the youth to imitate him, if what he did were pleaſing and voluptuous, or expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf to laughter, and deriſion if his actions were ridiculous.</p>

                  <p>IT happens very oft, that thoſe who have not any qualities whereby to render themſelves commendable, will ſeek to gain authority by an affectation of wiſdom, a
<pb facs="tcp:170183:28"/>haughty countenance, or an imperious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, not ſpeaking but with diſjointed words, or elſe extending to a prolixity of diſcourſe, as if they did preach, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their follies like rare ſentences. The poor youth who hears, but underſtands them not, is more confounded, then inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by his precepts; and as thoſe things which diſpleaſe do eaſily diſtaſt, from this diſguſt they come to ſlight ſuch things, and from this ſlighting there ariſes hatred, which does encreaſe if they ſtrive to uſe force: This they endeavour to remedy by harſh means, or ruder ſtripes, and ſo loſe their power by too much uſing of it, or if they meet a docile ſpirit, they make it by ſuch unhandſome treatments to become dull, and degenerate. They commit ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fault, which has ruined many perſons of fair hopes, and promiſes, and that by order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; proportioning, or diſpoſing of things according to their own nature, and not to the capacity of him they govern. Like a Taylor that ſhould take meaſure of his own
<pb facs="tcp:170183:28"/>body for another mans cloaths, or as a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician who over loving <hi>Bacchus</hi> his ſucking bottle himſelf, ſhould preſcribe Wine to another man in the height of a burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. They will reform the ſubject they are working on, in ſtead of conforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his ability. It muſt be his care that inſtructs to prepare fit precepts for him that is to learn. It is much eaſier to change the Leſſons, then to alter his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. When a Glove is too ſtrait, we muſt not cut, or pare away the hand, but chooſe another Glove that better fits it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe faults proceed from three different cauſes, which makes three ſorts of Pedants. The firſt is want of judgment, and that is eſſential, and incorrigible, and ſuch kind of people ſhould never undertake to govern others, wanting indeed the skill to rule, and govern themſelves. Thoſe have this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe that they do every thing out of time, and never keep a due regularity, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in their actions, if they reprove, 'tis
<pb facs="tcp:170183:29"/>not without exceſs, and outrage, if they Praiſe 'tis without diſcretion, they refuſe what they ſhould grant, and permit what they ſhould forbid; ſometimes they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Spirit by too great a licence, and otherwhile depreſs, and reſtrain it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of rigour, and wanting a foundation of firm, and ſolid principles they do good, or evil only by hap-hazzard.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170183:29"/>Common-wealth, can never be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. They ſpeak only out of Books, and reaſon altogether with others Arguments; and though they are not ignorant of what they ſhould do, yet how to do any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, they are to ſeek for. They will produce myriads of examples, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, but not one that is expedient. If you ask them counſel, they will give you <hi>Seneca</hi>'s or <hi>Plutarchs,</hi> they are more knowing in the intrigues of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> then in thoſe of <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Spain.</hi> They have ſtudied replies, for al ſorts of complements, which they uſe without choice, or diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are forc'd to tye up their tongues in a more becoming ſilence, when that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed ſtore is exhauſted.

<pb facs="tcp:170183:30"/>which they diſtribute amongſt the living, and muſt ſtill have a conſultation with their Authors, and Maſters, before they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their diſciples.

Of theſe three ſorts, the firſt is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, the ſecond unprofitable, the laſt troubleſome, and importunate. The one guides not the judgement aright, the other confounds and intangles it, and the third diſpleaſes, and diſtaſtes it: It is almoſt the ſame with young, and delicate imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and deſires, as with great bellied Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who mark the fruit of their Wombs, with impreſſions of thoſe objects that are moſt expoſed to their ſight, according as they fancy, or delight in them, for which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny douſe to place the ſweeteſt, &amp; moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing objects they can before them, that ſo beholding, and conſidering nothing but what is lovely, they may conceive hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and rare Ideas.

                  <p>HE will at firſt find work enough which nature hath prepared for him; for a young ſoul how noble, or high ſoe're it be, is ever full of many defects which he muſt weed out carefully in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb facs="tcp:170183:32"/>before he caſt the good ſeed in it. They are ſo many diſpoſitions contrary to vertue, which muſt be rid thence, before you can bring him to a right poſture. As before grace can be received, we muſt be throughly purged from fin. The moſt common are ſtubbornneſs, ſloath, ſelf-love, credulity, averſion from all labour, levity, immodeſty, depraved appetites, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, of which ſome are born with us; others are communicated by contagion, which often ſucceed one another, and are ready to ſpring up afreſh in the rooms of thoſe we had newly rooted out thence.

                  <p>PHiloſophers aſſign three means to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our ſelves: the one is to fly from thoſe objects, to which we are allured; the ſecond is to oppoſe, and combat our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons one with another: and the third is to aſſault them openly by meet ſtrength of
<pb facs="tcp:170183:33"/>reaſon. The firſt of theſe is neither gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, nor alwayes effectual; becauſe we happen oft to meet that which we think to fly from, nor is that the way to ſtrike to the root of the evil. <hi>Chi é ferito nel cuore in van ſi fugge.</hi> The ſecond is not vertuous, though it be utile. The third is more He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick and noble, but likewiſe 'tis more difficult. The beſt meanes, is to blend, and apply all theſe three together with diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according as the exigency requires. Sometimes they muſt be diverted, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd by the luſtre, and clear light of truth, by the charming beauty of vertue, and the loathſome deformity of vice; other times by ſhunning its ſight and rencontre, and now and then excluding them by entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome other honeſt pleaſures, which may thruſt them quite out of doors. When we would weaken an enemy, we create diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt them. So muſt we likewiſe do by our paſſions, caſt in the apple of diſcord and let them be deſtroyed, one by another. The deſires of Glory, and Honour hath
<pb facs="tcp:170183:34"/>ſtifled the motions of ſenſuality in many breaſts. The love of Women has often made a narrow covetous heart to become liberal, yea prodigal; But he muſt have a mighty care to hinder that paſſion that is Victor from triumphing over the liberty of the ſoul, leſt it ſhould erect an abſolute ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny there. Nor muſt we utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the paſſions, but only tame, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate their exceſs: for they are vicious on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in as much as they exceed; and being brought to a juſt, and even temper, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſtruments of vertue, and make the ſoul act with the more life and vigour.</p>

The firſt is touching the Body, and the other the Soul; for theſe two parts being recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally dependents, and concurrents together in actions, they have both need of culture.
<pb facs="tcp:170183:35"/>If Polititians give Princes maximes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to command well, they likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Laws to Subjects to obey well.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over although habits depend upon the ſoul as their original, yet there are ſome which reſide in the body as in their proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: It is therefore needful that he have diſpoſitions fitted to receive them, as well as a ſoul to produce and bring them forth.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Three ſorts of corporal habitudes.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe corporal habits are of three ſorts, ſome conſiſt of interiour actions, and the conformity of the body with the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or part, by means of which it obeys, and ſubmits without repugnance to whatever reaſon preſcribes, even againſt, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to its own appetites. Theſe are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
<pb facs="tcp:170183:35"/>but through long uſe and practice, and are the perfection, and conſummation of mans wiſedom. The ſecond have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther object, and look not ſo much to the ſoul, as upon its union with the body, both which naturally deſire their own preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By theſe a man uſes to reſtrain, and deprive himſelfe of all thoſe things that might haſten his end, or diſcompoſe his health. And becauſe young people through want of knowledge, of care, and of power to govern, and curb themſelves, do eaſily yield to ſuch things as do them hurt, and becauſe the ſame nature which gives them the inſtinct to preſerve their health, does likewiſe give them an appeti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to follow that which does deſtroy it. Therefore thoſe that have them in their charge muſt wiſely ſupply thoſe little defects of their age, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity managing ſo precious a jewel; not that I would take away the uſe of all things that are pleaſing, or offend nature whileſt I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to protect it, nor make that life unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py which I would prolong: no, I would
<pb facs="tcp:170183:36"/>only pare away what is ſuperfluous. That which is neceſſary, is never hurtful, and what is exceſſive, can never be neceſſary. Nature, ſayes <hi>Seneca,</hi> is content with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, one may eaſily ſatisfie it, opinion hath never enough, becauſe it hath no bounds, or limits, but ſtill leaps from one deſire to another. Let us therefore allow nature what ſhe ought to have, and take from opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion what we ought not to give it. This is a vertue eſſential to an honeſt man, which I place amongſt thoſe of the body, not that it proceeds not from the empire of the ſoul: But becauſe it terminates primitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the body, and tends to take away the means of annoying the ſpirit &amp; life. I place this not only in the moderation of eating &amp; drinking, but univerſally in the abſtinence, from all exceſs and diſorder, which decayes the body, over-clouds the ſpirit and mind, enervates the ſtrength and force, invades the health, ſhortens the life, and makes the ſoul to become a ſlave to its own luſt, and pleaſures. I am willing one ſhould taſte of
<pb facs="tcp:170183:36"/>innocent enjoyments; but not that they ſhould enjoy, and enchain us. We ſhould make uſe of them as Princes do of their Buffoons, whoſe counſel they never take, nor ever call them into their preſence, but when they mean to loſe an hour, or two in paſtime. Of all kinds of exceſs that of the mouth is the moſt ſhameful, and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial: for being groſs, and material, it makes a man all fleſh, and blood; and, as all that is ſuperfluous in us, turns into ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which are moſt predominant. If we are melancholy, it breeds and amaſſes black humors, encreaſes choler, and inflames the blood; and ſo of others the like; and therefore we thereby do but lend weapons to our paſſions to make a civil war in our own boſomes, or heap up fewel on thoſe flames that ſhall conſume us. From thence ariſe thoſe groſs vapours which climb into our brain, making us dull, and heavy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, teſty, and ſometimes depriving us even of the liberty of its functions. And this begets alſo another unhappineſs which
<pb facs="tcp:170183:37"/>is that we accuſtome, and ſubject our ſelves ſo much to ſuperfluous things, that being changed into habits, they become at laſt altogether neceſſary to us. Which is a reaſon why great perſons, who are wont to live more delicately then others, are much more to be pitied when reduced to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtanding in need of much more then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her ſelf does want for her converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Cato</hi> feared the ſobriety of <hi>Caeſar</hi> more then his courage. 'Tis that which made him indefatigable in his labours, as fortune made him invincible to his enemies. He eat little, laboured much, went on foot in the front of his Armies, bare-headed in the moſt ſcorching heats of Summer, and the moſt biting Winter froſts. He uſed his body to all hardſhips, and inconveniencies, and gave it no more repoſe then what was needful to continue his labour: But above all 'tis noted that he drank very little wine. Thoſe who cannot imitate him, I ſhal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel them at leaſt to follow him as neer as they can; if they mean to ſucceed him in
<pb facs="tcp:170183:37"/>his glory. This vertue muſt be acquired by degrees, and ſteps, uſing the body by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little to be deprived of its eaſe, or at leaſt not to be ſubject to it. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cannot be practiſed without uſing a kind of violence to nature. But being for its good, there ſhould be no complaint, ſince the remedy though it be harſh is ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
                  <p>The third ſort are touching the body and exteriour actions, conſiſting in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, which are ordinarily taught the young Nobility, for which having particular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the Governor need to have no other care, but to make him be aſſiduous, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and to make him to love thoſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, in ſuch ſort, that he do not thereby draw off his affection from higher and more noble things, but eſteem of them as his divertiſement, not his imployment. For thoſe are no fundamental qualities, nor do they make a man commendable of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but only in as much as they direct him towards vertue, and are joined to the
<pb facs="tcp:170183:38"/>divine graces of his mind and ſpirit, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in men of great quality, who will not take any profeſſion, and ſhould only ſcorn to be altogether ignorant of them. In this rank I place riding the great horſe, fencing, muſick both of voice, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, dancing, vaulting, plauſibility of ſpeech, a graceful garb, and accort carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, a handſome mind and preſence, and all other ſuch like qualities which only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his behaviour, and comelineſs of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which indeed one ſhould endeavour to have, but never propound them as the higheſt aime, or perfection, but as orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and embelliſhments fitting for men of rank and quality. For as great perſons never put all their eſtates in Jewels, and ornaments, ſo neither muſt we make our capital and foundation of ſuch vertues, which may be common to vitious perſons. Neither muſt we deſpiſe them; becauſe they are handſome additions, and little heightnings, which ſets off the luſtre of the ſoule, with greater advantage, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
<pb facs="tcp:170183:38"/>The beſt Maxime I can give to gain theſe, and to do all things compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is to do them without conſtraint, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, with a natural aſſurance, and an ingenuous confidence, imploying all on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For in that inſtant that we make a ſhew of knowing much, and doing things well, or having a good opinion of our ſelves, we gain the diſeſteem of all others.

                  </head>
                  <p>THe Second, and principal end, and aim of the Governor, is to dreſs and cultivate the ſoul, which we conſider two wayes, according to the divers functions it does exerciſe. Firſt, as it imagines, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, retains, and digeſts the ſpecies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the ſenſes. Secondly, as it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and deliberates. The firſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of three powers, which require an exact care: for from thoſe all the defects, or perfections of man do ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, <hi>viz.</hi> from the imagination, common ſenſe, and the memory: The firſt of theſe muſt be regulated in its deſignes, diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red agitations, its falſe apprehenſion of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and above all vulgar opinions, which conſiſt in admiring too facilely, acting by
<pb facs="tcp:170183:39"/>cuſtome and by example, embracing the judgement of others, paſſionately ſiding with parties, loving, hating, praiſing, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming without good grounds, entertaining opinions, becoming refractory, and eaſily reliſhing, and favouring the paſſions, and intereſts of others, judging and cenſuring all things, and a thouſand other ſuch like weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which ariſe from the imbecillity, or lazineſs of the imagination, which had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rely, and truſt the reports of others, then take the pains to preſent every thing to the judgment to examine them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He muſt be careful therefore to fit and fraight the imagination with good, and choice things, maintain it in a liberty of conſidering and weighing every thing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to ſolid things, and ſhewing him the vanity of thoſe objects it apprehends, and falſely admires. This power and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hath one great defect, which is that it repreſents things greater then they are, and often abuſes the mind and will, making them beleeve and deſire that which is falſe
<pb facs="tcp:170183:40"/>and evil. He muſt endeavour earneſtly to enlighten this, and reſtrain that impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which does overſway, and biaſs it, and makes it rove and wander, and this he muſt fix on what it does, and mingle ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with all its occupations that it may ſtil be preſent, for having ſome pleaſing end, it will wholly apply it ſelfe thereto, and not be ſcattered, and parcel'd towards ſo many ſeveral objects at the ſame time.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe ſecond, which is the commonſenſe, is a peece of great importance. 'Tis that which purifies, diſgeſts, and ranges all the ſpecies in a prepared readineſs for the mind, and judgement. One muſt therefore be very careful to teach him all things with an eaſie method, and a certain order, that may make him ſee every thing clearly, and not entangle and perplex him, ſtrengthning
<pb facs="tcp:170183:40"/>him with univerſal principles, which may ſerve him for a foundation, by no meanes confounding, or puzling him with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of precepts, and leſſons: But by a ſweet ſucceſſion make him paſs from one ſtep to another, raiſing him by degrees from the loweſt, to the higheſt things, and uſing him betimes to obſerve the like order in all his actions, and to ſuſtain himſelf upon firm principles. This contributes very much to judgement and diſcourſe, and is extream neceſſary, as well for the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of profound Sciences, as for the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conduct of ones life.</p>
                  <p>The third which is Memory, hath been ſlighted, and deſpiſed by many men. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> makes but ſmal account of it, yet there are others that approve, and improve it as much as poſſible. To me it ſeems very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: as Barns and Cellars to thoſe that will buy proviſions of Corn and Wine. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, according to that Idea which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of an auſtere Savage, and unſociable Wiſdom which ſome affect, it is not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:170183:41"/>conſiderable to them. But for ſuch as will tame, and familiarize Vertue, and Sciences, and make them enter into our common commerce, and converſation, ſuch ought to make good proviſion of things laying up a ſtore in the cells, and repoſitories of their memory, to make uſe of upon occaſion, it being needful for them to know how peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lived in times paſt, as well as what the Modes of the times preſent are. It is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly requiſite for thoſe that intermeddle with affairs of State, either in Peace or War. It playes its part in all occurrences, and ought ſtill to accompany the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Secretary that hath the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all its regiſters, and does firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound all the ſubjects on which a man is to act: It is requiſite likewiſe for the facility, and elegancy of diſcourſe, to provide fit, and apt words whereby to expreſs our thoughts quaintly, without grating the ears of the hearers, by disjointed and harſh words, which ſeem as they were drawn like a bucket out of a deep well, and yet run like
<pb facs="tcp:170183:41"/>a kennel, whoſe little ſtream follows in a continual ſucceſſion, without the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval till it is quite dry. This is one of thoſe exterior qualities which indeed ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a man more grateful, and is ſomewhat rare in theſe days. We find many that have merit and ſufficiency enough, and yet are ſo unhappy in this particular, that like large bottles with narrow necks, there comes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them but drop by drop. Others have a great facility in ſpeaking ill, both importuning, and ſtopping thoſe ears that liſten to them. Theſe are not content to be ſots only, unleſs all the world know it; if they have a ſtory to relate, they muſt needs make its beginning riſe with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, and then they dwell ſo long upon frivolous circumſtances, that they are inſenſibly drawn to other matters, into which they hop, like birds from branch to branch, and ſometimes in the very midſt of their relation they wander ſo far from the ſubject they had in hand, that they are forc'd to ſeek about for it again, as the young lad
<pb facs="tcp:170183:42"/>did for his Fathers Aſſes: Others to raiſe themſelves above the vulgar, eſteem it too mean for them to uſe the ſame words as their Servants do, coyn many new ones, and for fear they ſhould ſpeak like others, they uſe a canting Jargon which none can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand without an interpreter. A young man muſt faſhion himſelf betimes to a good dialect, his language muſt be ſmooth, intelligible, ſignificant, and as conciſe as poſſible can be without obſcurity. To which three things are neceſſary; a promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, or ſwiftneſs of thoughts, an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of choice words, and language, and apt diſpoſition to it. The firſt requires the preſence, and vivacity of imagination. The ſecond a ſtrong retentive memory: The third, a clean and able common ſenſe. Such as have theſe three gifts, have a great advantage above others. Nevertheleſs art, and ſtudy may bring a man to theſe, though of himſelfe he have but little inclination to them. To this end, one ſhould be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from infancy, when we are moſt apt
<pb facs="tcp:170183:42"/>to retain, and when theſe powers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly moſt vigorous. <hi>Caeſars</hi> eloquence is attributed to his Mother <hi>Aurelia.</hi> Shee ſpake her language purely, and by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual converſe imprinted that neat and flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent language, in him which we ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire in all his writings. The young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, ſhould therefore have one by him, that knows all the beauties and graces of ſpeech, which he muſt teach him in all his converſation, not only pointing out his faults, but inſtructing him in the quaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he muſt uſe in his diſcourſe; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo exerciſing him by writing letters on all kinds of ſubjects, which will be a means to compleat him in his ſtile, and language.</p>

                  <p>REading does much enlarge and open the underſtanding, and make the memory
<pb facs="tcp:170183:43"/>fruitful in good words. But the Governor muſt make choice of books for him, and then let him form and ſhape his ſtile of himſelf, without tying, or obliging him to any example: For diſcourſe, and writing being the images of the ſoul; every one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his thoughts differently according to his own genius, which if it be made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to another, will appear full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and affectation. 'Tis no matter how he ſpeaks, or writes, ſo he do it well: And the beſt rule that one can give him, is to let him ſee how others have ſpoken, and then let him do, as he ſhall judge beſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Another means and help to improve the memory; is to exereiſe it often, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome it daily to retain ſomewhat, not to uſe in a vain oſtentation; but to feed it with good nouriſhment, which by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle changes into our own proper nature, and enlightens the mind to improve, and heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thoſe conceptions which we gather, and cull from others, and keeps the memory from decaying for want of exerciſe. And
<pb facs="tcp:170183:43"/>to this purpoſe the Governor muſt be of ingenious, as to whiten two walls with one bruſh. That's to ſay, that ſince the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe muſt be filled, let him take care that it be not toyes and trumpery, or which is yet worſe, ſordid ordure; but let them be uſeful, and excellent things, which may one day ſerve to aſſiſt his judgement, when he ſhall come to that maturity, as to know how to manage them. Young men are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſet to learn <hi>Horace, Martials</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams, <hi>Cicero's</hi> Epiſtles, and other ſuch like things, but I would not have him dwell too long upon thoſe, nor vainly fit that place with them, which is ordained for more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treaſures. There ſhould be nothing hoarded up, which may not be beneficial in its time, and therefore there muſt be a great regard to the quality, and condition of him that is to be taught, and to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion he intends to follow afterwards, thereby to teach and inſtruct him in ſuch principles as are fit, and laying them up in his memory, even before he throughly
<pb facs="tcp:170183:44"/>comprehends them, by reaſon of his youth. Theſe are ſuch proviſions, and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as are requiſite to be made ready for the judgment, againſt it begins to act; that ſo it may find all the materials rightly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, according to the deſign before reſolved on; But above all things he muſt be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed amply with wholeſome, and ſage do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments, both for his ſociety, manners, and the actions of his life. And when theſe three powers ſhall be thus brought, and ranked in their juſt poſture, it will not be difficult to raiſe the ſoul to a high pitch of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding, and to enflame the will with an ardent love of true honour. There is no more to do, but only to elect, amongſt the great number of things, which may be known, thoſe which are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſuitable to his birth and and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and life being very ſhort, and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces infinitely many, he muſt take meaſure of the neceſſity which nature hath impoſed on us; and not being able to attain to the knowledge of all, chuſe thoſe which are

                  <p>THe firſt peece wherewith he muſt be armed, and furniſhed; is that true, and eſſential Piety, which is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all other vertues, and the path to our maine, and laſt end, without which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfections are but vain appearances, and falſe Diamonds, which have indeed a little gliſtering likeneſs, but want the true luſtre, worth and value of the true beauteous Jewel. 'Tis that which will conduct us to ſoveraign perfection, which renders us pleaſing to God, and to men, which makes our lawful deſigns proſper, and ſhields us, or rather takes away the juriſdiction of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Let him therefore be aſſiduouſly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful above all things, to plant and water the ſeeds of Religion, as he made promiſe at his Baptiſm, and let him endeavour to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb facs="tcp:170183:45"/>in all the things he beholds the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and wonders of his God; let him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome, and uſe himſelf betimes, in the days of his youth, to invoke and adore him on all occaſions, and knit himſelfe ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, that no power in this world may be able to divide, and ſeparate him. There are ſome who fancy an incompatibility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the Court, and beleeving the ſoul is indiviſible, think it impoſſible to be ſhared betwixt thoſe two Maſters. But this is eaſie to be reconciled, if we conſider God, as the chief and higheſt end, towards whom, and in whom all our actions muſt tend, and center, and look on the Court as the circle wherein we muſt run, and the Theater on which we muſt act our parts. Though all the ſphears follow, and obey the <hi>primum mobile;</hi> that hinders not, but they at the ſame time do move in their own ſphears; we may ſubmit to this firſt cauſe, and yet act in the world. Thoſe abuſes, and bad examples which are in Courts, are not in the nature of them, nor by inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb facs="tcp:170183:45"/>they crowd in there by force, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main there without eſtabliſhment, and if a ſoul be guided aright, it ſtill find more cauſe to admire the providence, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, then occaſions to offend him. The ancient Fathers found the Divel in the deſerts. He ranges about Cloiſters, Cells, and ſecret meeting places; and as vertue hath no confined abode, but preſents it ſelfe to any invitation; So neither is vice limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor hath any ſetled dwelling, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles into every corner where 'tis entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſoftly cheriſhed. How brave a thing it is to ſee a young man, of great quality, make an open profeſſion of Piety, and be ſtudious, and careful to keep his ſoul pure, and untainted, from the ſoyl, and leprous ſpots of ſin. What man can refuſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and affection, to him that pleaſes his God? And what is he not able to perform, when he that can do all things is his friend, and counſellor? I ſpeak not of that moroſe and ſervile devotion, which apprehends God, more then it loves him, and never
<pb facs="tcp:170183:46"/>conſiders him, but as a Judge. Such a vertue, if it deſerve that noble name, proceeds only from a baſe timorous ſoul, and laſts no longer then the dread and fear poſſeſſes them. I have known many, that have been very preciſe, and retired in their greener years, having the image of hell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before their eyes, and being in their thoughts ſurrounded with a legion of divels ſtill ready to torment them, as ſoon as they ſhould have committed but the leaſt <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillio;</hi> and yet luſts, and ſenſual pleaſures did delight, and tickle their hearts, and thoughts, but they durſt not adventure to taſte them, becauſe they feared the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By little and little they began to fortifie and encourage themſelves againſt theſe apprehenſions, and ſeeing others ſin without death, or viſible danger; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured at laſt to imitate them, and in a ſhort ſpace left moſt others behind them, in their unhappy progreſſe to damnation. So that this vertue, which ariſes only from a ſervile fear, may be fitly compared to
<pb facs="tcp:170183:46"/>thoſe golden Apples, guarded by Dragons, which were ſoon loſt, when the ugly Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons were defeated. I mean, therefore a true ſolid Piety, whereby a man loves God out of a pure principle of eſteem, becauſe he is abſolutely good, and perfect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues thus, till he by his eſpecial grace vouchſafes to turn that eſteem into tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and higher flames of heavenly love and zeal, and fear to offend him, as we fear to diſpleaſe thoſe whom we entirely love, and not onely as we apprehend to oppoſe that power which we dread. To bring him to this, he muſt be led and guided with ſweetneſſe, by facile, and honeſt means, which may neither breed repugnance, or wearineſſe in him; and not impoſe devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a yoak, but invite him to it, as a means to ſet his ſoul at reſt, and calm his paſſions with tranquillity, arming him againſt all accidents, and alluring all hearts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to him. By diſcourſing frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the immenſe goodneſſe, and mercy of God, making him delight in the ſweet mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb facs="tcp:170183:47"/>of a quiet, and pure conſcience, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him good examples, entertaining him with little, but often repeated acts of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, furniſhing him inceſſantly with high and ſacred thoughts of this real good, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely preventing any thing that might divert him, and reaping ſome profit, and advantage of every little accident that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervenes, by making him admire Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in them all; and all this with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain method, which neither is Bigot, nor ſcrupulous.</p>

                  <p>FRom this root of Piety, Modeſty will ſpring up, which is one of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, and amiable things, and yet one of the rareſt that is amongſt men, eſpecially ſuch as are of high births. It conſiſts in words, and in actions; and I eſteem it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neceſſary for any man, that will
<pb facs="tcp:170183:47"/>perform great actions. It wins mens hearts, which are the ſprings, and engins, whereby difficult things muſt be executed: it begets a familiar confidence immediately in thoſe that treat with us, when they behold a friendly, and ingenuous countenance, which neither ſtoops to ſoft affected careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor wanders after apiſh, ridiculous fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faronneries, but carries an even temper. For men uſe to give little credit to thoſe that overflow in the mouth; above all one ſhould never ſpeak of ones ſelfe, neither good nor ill; for fear of being diſproved, or avowed; the vertue of that man will be thought very little, that's forc'd to trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet forth his own praiſes. He ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and make himſelfe known by his brave actions, and not feign it by ſpecious words. It hath its defect, and its exceſſe. The proud have changed it into gravity, and the effeminate into ſoftneſſe. The one is full of vanity, as much as the other, and they differ onely in that they take divers ways to ſeek the ſame falſe glory; the one
<pb facs="tcp:170183:48"/>exacting it as a tribute, the other begging it as an almes. To find a mean, and keep the right path, we need but to obſerve this, we muſt render our ſelves worthy of all honor, and not trouble our ſelves with others, if they do not pay that honour to us, which we juſtly deſerve, for this being above our reach, and diſpoſing, and depending on the fancies of others, we muſt be content that we at leaſt deſerve it, though we do not receive it. He that wou'd never come to be deſpiſed, let him do nothing that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome, and let him neither become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on another through vain hope, nor tyranny over any, becauſe of higher abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. There are other particular means which muſt be taught young men, as to know perfectly all the civilities, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, modes, and cuſtomes, which men have invented, and do practiſe, according to the places, birth, and dignities of every one; teach the youth alſo to receive every one courteouſly, and to ſend them away well ſatisfied, to know the difference of
<pb facs="tcp:170183:48"/>every one, their intereſts, and paſſions, thereby to behave himſelfe with judgment accordingly, and to acquire a free, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſpirit, which may put it ſelfe into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny form, and ſhape, comply with any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour without conſtraint, or affectation. Which he may eaſily do, if he firſt free himſelfe from the vanity, and love of his own opinions. Let him fit his diſcourſe to his own, or the companies capacity, and conform it to the time preſent, uſing no ſtudied complements, but ſpeaking modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and indifferently. There are ſome who embrace the firſt commer, uſe the ſame ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes to all the world, and through a facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of promiſing, reduce themſelves to the neceſſity of deceiving. He ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed betimes of all baſh-full ſhame, and train'd up to a generous confidence, ſo that he be not ſubject to a timorous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, but either grant, or refuſe, with a courteous boldneſſe, and make a handſome retreat in any dangerous occaſion, to which many hazzard themſelves for want of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb facs="tcp:170183:49"/>to deny. Let him ſet one hour apart every day, to conſider, and make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions on his paſt actions, and mildly point out to him his ſailings, and how he might have done better, and have pleaſed ſome whom he ſent away diſcontented, without any prejudice to himſelf, how he might have diſengaged himſelfe from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that was not fitting for him, ſhewing him that he did not anſwer ſo generouſly as he might, to what was ſpoken, that he conteſted too long for his own opinion, that he had not teſtified ſo much gratitude as was requiſite for ſome ſervice which was done him, that he neglected to gain a good friend, and oblige an honourable perſon; and eſpecially in the cloſe of the day, make him reliſh the ſweetneſs there is in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying his time nobly, and profitably, and the bitterneſs in loſing, or miſpending it. Sometimes lauding, or blaming him, even ſhewing more love, and reſpect, as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes in vertue, and nobleneſſe, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying an indifferency, and froideur, when
<pb facs="tcp:170183:49"/>he declines, procuring all his friends, in whom he truſts and confides, to do the ſame, by ſeeming to withdraw their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him, when he falls into any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage. And in fine, loſing no occaſion to make uſe of for his advantage.</p>

                  <p>IF one will have him become a man of honour, one muſt make him be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor'd betimes with true honour, and breed an averſion in him to all that might ſtain, or ſoil him. This quality conſiſts in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, and particularly in being true, ſincere, and cordial, eſpecially keeping ones faith, and promiſe religiouſly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, which gains a marvellous eſteem, and credit in the world, deceits, and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are nets, which are eaſily diſcovered if they be too groſſe, and are quickly broken if they be more finely woven.

<pb facs="tcp:170183:50"/>not ſuffer him by any means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to lye, or to deceive, even in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. In this caſe only I wiſh him to uſe ſeverity; For 'tis ſo inſinuating, and ſubtile, that at the leaſt connivence, it takes footing, and if it get the ſmalleſt root, it multiplies abundantly, and can never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated. It makes every one keep at a diſtance from us, blurs the reputation, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the manners, and diſcredits all we ſay; That 'tis the wiſdom of Kings to diſſemble, had need to be interpreted, and well expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. That may be true of their paſſions, their deſignes, and their reſentments for injuries they have received, when the good of their affairs does in this manner oblige them to play <hi>Deſoubs le maſque,</hi> under a viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; for they ought not to conſider of their particular perſons, or affairs, but in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the good of the State, for whoſe ſafety they ought to ſacrifice all their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate paſſions. But to feign, and promiſe, that which they wil never perform, to make ſnares of their words, inſtead of ſecurity,
<pb facs="tcp:170183:50"/>and an aſyle, to write and treat captiouſly, and proſtrate their honour, and conſcience to their intereſt; This is the vertue of Tyrants, which helps ſometimes to aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize them, but can never make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned. True policy, does not conſiſt in this, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter.

                  <p>IT is very difficult to bring him to ſuch a perfect rule, unleſſe one call in the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences for their aſſiſtance, which fortifie the mind againſt vices, divertiſe him from bad imployments, animates him to the love of vertue, enlarges the underſtanding either for diſcourſe, or action, on all occaſions;
<pb facs="tcp:170183:51"/>Not that I would have him poſſeſſe them as a Maſter, nor that he ſhould ſpend ſo much time in meditation, which he ows to a more active life.

But amongſt that infinite number of Sciences, which one ſingle humane wit cannot fathom, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; he muſt chuſe ſuch as are moſt uſeful for his life, and conduct, leading him to the knowledge of them by facile wayes, and not as many uſe to teach them. They make them become ſo unſociable that no body dares approach them. But he ſhould ſtrip off the prickles, and preſent him only
<pb facs="tcp:170183:51"/>the roſes. It will be therefore very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that he that ſhall inſtruct him do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe them purely himſelfe, and know how to mannage and accommodate them to the affairs of the world, that ſo he may draw out ſuch ſap, as may afterwards turn into ſubſtance; for this he will not ſo much need thoſe profound Sciences, which ſerve for oſtentation, as thoſe that are profitable and a judicious skill to fit, and prepare his leſſons to the young Gentlemans capacity, and need.

                  <p>THis is a queſtion which I wil not here decide, I will content my ſelf in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating what I have obſerved on this ſubject, leaving the judgement of it to better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. There are ſome maintain, that in the Colledges, and publick Schooles, bad examples, are more frequent, and more taking then good ones. That there one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes acquainted with all ſorts of people, and of all conditions, who not being train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in any manners, do eaſily imprint their defects in a young ſpirit: That one wallows eight or ten years in that duſt only, to learn the Latine Tongue, and a few ſhreds of Hiſtory worth nothing, becauſe they are but pieces disjointed, which have
<pb facs="tcp:170183:52"/>no dependence: that they often change their Maſters, and by conſequence alter the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and rules of learning: That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are ordinarily young, and ſerve their Apprentiſeſhips at their Scholars coſt, as new Phyſitians do in Hoſpitals. Beſides, having the charge of ſo many, they cannot take ſuch particular care of every one. But now turn the other reverſe of the medal, and we ſhall find, that young men in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, are inſtructed by ſuch as are learned, pious, and faithful: that they animate one another by examples, and emulation: they exerciſe by ſpeaking in publick, they note the defects, or perfections of each other; they are ambitious to appear more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently then their fellows: The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and recompenſes do move them to deſire, and fear: They apprehend their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings more, becauſe their faults are publick, they do communicate what they know to one another: they have ſet times and rules preſcribed, which ſerve very much to their advancement; and the Sciences are taught
<pb facs="tcp:170183:53"/>them by certain degrees, and ſteps, which eaſily lead the judgement from one thing to another.</p>
                  <p>Here we muſt conſider touching our young Cavalier, that one muſt as much as is poſſible, make him frequent ſuch perſons, whoſe judgements are well ſetled, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and who nevertheleſſe have the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and ingenuity to accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his tender age. And that one muſt regard the Sciences in this young man, but only as an inſtrument which is neceſſary to help, and further his other exerciſes, to which he is allotted, and that he ought to ſeek them, but only in as much as they open the underſtanding, fortifie the mind, ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his behaviour, and embelliſh his ſoul, not that he ſhould become a Profeſſor, a Preacher, a Judge, or a Philoſopher: But a Souldier, a Polititian, a Courtier, and man of action and affairs; and therefore it will ſuffice him to know, as much as he ought not to be ignorant of, and not ſo much as 'tis poſſible to know, but what is fit, and
<pb facs="tcp:170183:53"/>ſufficient to attain his ends, that they may ſerve him as a wheel to facilitate his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and turnings, and not prove a weight, to toyle, and overburden his mind. They muſt therefore be prepared for him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, that he may uſe them in his life and actions, and he that hath this great charge of him, muſt take ſpecial care, to direct all his leſſons and inſtructions to that mark and end.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe it will be needful to teach him the Latine tongue, as ſuccinctly, and purely as 'tis poſſible, and not trouble him with all thoſe affected words, and phraſes which many look after, and make uſe of that they may not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>

Many have judged it uſeleſſe, and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the active life: becauſe that by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſoul up to contemplation, it as 'twere unties it from the body, which ſhould act. And indeed, I would have him poſſeſſe it as his Wife, and not as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. I mean, that he ſhould have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable love for her, and that ſhe might be ſubject to him, but not a paſſion, which would make him become a ſlave. I would have him be ſerved by her, inſtead of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her, and not do anything without her
<pb facs="tcp:170183:56"/>counſel; I would have him know that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which diſcourſes, which enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, which rules our manners, which loves ſociety: and not that which raves, which contends, which creates Chimera's, and loves naught but ſolitude. This laſt is vain, ridiculous, importunate, and idle. The firſt is ſolid, pleaſing, tranquil, and ſalutary. And I eſteem it no leſs needful for a man that is expoſed to the ſtorms, and agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Courts, then the Rudder and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe is to a Ship. But not to loſe time, one muſt leave out all that is ſuperfluous, and take only that which is ſubſtantial nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, teaching him to reaſon and argue handſomely, to draw one thing skilfully from another, to maintain a good poſition firmly, to divide and diſtinguiſh aright, and diſcover and untie all ſophiſticate, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious arguments. This art ſerves for all things, and may be applyed on any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In counſels they do nothing but reaſon, and argue. In Courts all their art conſiſts in drawing conſequences, and penetrating
<pb facs="tcp:170183:56"/>into things unknown, by the appearance. War is a continual reaſoning. And in fine, man cannot ſhew he is ſuch, but by that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The world attributes all to experience alone: But art teaches the rules, which are truely drawn from thence, but purified and ſet on work by thoſe, whom ſhe had moſt illuminated, which makes us enjoy without labour, the fruit of thoſe labours, wherein they have waſted their lives.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170183:57"/>then his profit. But as to that part, which concerns his manners, and which teaches one to ſeek for tranquillity, and to ſet the ſoul at repoſe, to reſtrain vice, practiſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſuffer the blows of fortune conſtantly and nobly, to be undaunted and reſolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt dangers, to deſpiſe death, and not to be inveigled with the love of falſe honours: of this he muſt make his principal and ſtock, from whence he may all his life time ſupply himſelfe with thoſe treaſures, which will be neceſſary for him, in the voyage he is to make thorow the world, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in knowing, and often reflecting ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon himſelfe. Without this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, we are apt to fall at every little oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.

It conſiſts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in operation, and does not teach the mind, but only that it ſhould maſter, and over rule the body: and to this end there muſt be a continual care, to make him practice every day vertuous actions
<pb facs="tcp:170183:57"/>according as the occaſions are preſented, teaching him to purifie them, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them gracefully without oſtentation, vain glory, or intereſt; being only affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that which is really juſt, and good. To love honeſt people, treating every one according to his merits, and not abuſing his own power: but preferring that which is right before any other intereſt; as for the choice of friends, 'tis a thing that I would leave to his own diſpoſition, only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing him of the good, or bad qualities, of thoſe whom he would honour with his confidence, drawing him, however handſomely away from ſuch, as would prove pernicious to him, and teaching him not to be too prodigal, and beſtow that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour too lightly: That ſo he may not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obliged to reſume it again and diſavow his election by a change.</p>

                  <p>AS for Policy, if he will attain to high things, he muſt be inſtructed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by a continual exerciſe. Not in that Policy which ſubjects all Law, Honour, and Conſcience it ſelfe, to private intereſt: But in that enlightned prudence, which foreſees the future without conſulting the Stars, which eſtabliſhes States by a ſolid, and durable government, which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, and obſerves the Laws: under the care whereof the people may peaceably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and which does furniſh fit remedies to every grievance, and diſtemper, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing wholeſome phyſick, and not dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing things over with emperical eſſences.</p>
                  <p>To lead him to this without trouble, one muſt begin betimes to diſpoſe and bend his mind to it, by accuſtoming him not to doe

On which he muſt be often exerciſed. After this, his mind being ſetled, and his judgement regulated, one muſt teach him the principles of this Science, the nature of all Governments, their Maximes, and fundamental Laws, the main Queſtions, which come in Controverſie; the divers kinds of Monarchies, and Republicks, thoſe things that ruines them, that which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments them, the remedies to hinder their

He that would know things as they are, muſt draw them from their ſource, and ſpring head. There happens a thouſand accidents in Travels, on which the ſpirit, and mind muſt exerciſe themſelves. We behold every where great example to inſtruct us. One frequents
<pb facs="tcp:170183:62"/>many kinds of people, of ſeveral humours, and ſpirits. One learnes the different cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, the orders, and Policy of every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; their civilities, their uſage, their laws, and their language, which breeds a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in us to their faſhions, and is a great advantage if we afterwards chance to have to do with them. This weanes one from his falſe love to his own country, and makes us Citizens of the whole world, or at leaſt brings one eaſily to comply with every one. Another great benefit which is reaped from hence is, that a man learnes to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Great men in their own Countries are environed with flatterers, who ſooth up, and diſguiſe their vices, and care for nothing, but to pleaſe them only. They receive nothing but reſpect, ſubmiſſions and complaiſances: they ſee none but ſuch, whom they have the power to command; and unleſs they be timely drawn off from it, they contract an imperious humor, and pride, and cannot endure any, but ſuch as fear them, becauſe they are us'd to awe all
<pb facs="tcp:170183:62"/>ſuch as live within the verge of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; But in ſtrange countries, they behold none, but unknown faces, who give them no more reſpect, and honour, then what they firſt receive from them, and from thence they learn indeed, what they truely are, by the eſteem ſuch men have for them, who neither pretend any thing from them, nor depend upon them. Beſides they become ſubject to the Laws of thoſe places where they go, and habituate themſelves by being forc'd to obſerve thoſe, to keep their own Laws voluntarily, which they might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe violate without fear of puniſhment: But they will need a guide to conduct them, and ſhew them how to make their profit of all things: otherwiſe they ſhall ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Walls, Cities, Palaces, and Fountains, and nothing but their eyes ſhall travel. One muſt make them penetrate into the intereſts of Courts, make compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of one, with another, taking notice of what is good, and bad, and ſtrive to make them become conſiderable in the eſteem of
<pb facs="tcp:170183:63"/>forraign Princes, and Miniſters of State, eſtabliſhing a ſtrict, and faithful correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency between them and thoſe men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown they ſhall meet with in their travels, that ſo they may become the more uſeful to their own Prince at home, as having theſe engins abroad, which may be able to act much for them, at a need in all great affairs. He muſt alſo be careful to bring them to the knowledge of all ſuch, as he ſhall heare of in any country who do excel in any Art, or Science. If he delight in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he will in ſhort time dive into their greateſt knowledge, and enrich himſelfe without trouble with their Secrets, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious learning: it being impoſſible but that from this frequentation, there ſhould remain much of that great light in him, which ſhall keep him from being deceived.</p>

Firſt, he muſt be made capable of the affairs of his houſe, of the ſtate of his goods, and rights, of his Subjects and his pretenſions, of his enemies if he have any, of the intrigues of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, of the order he muſt follow, not only to maintain himſelfe in their luſtre; but to raiſe and elevate himſelfe above his Predeceſſors: make him chuſe a rule to live by, and a determinate end, and aime, for his propounded object, on, and towards which he muſt frame all his actions, that ſo himſelf may be the guid of his own fortune, and not be dragg'd about after her wheele:
<pb facs="tcp:170183:65"/>like thoſe that act only by hazzard, and are not reſolved in any certain thing, but take their reſolution in the midſt of their race. 'Tis in this choice, that one muſt conſider his inclination, the capacity of his ſoul, and what promiſe there does appear, mildly following thoſe paths which nature ſhall ſeem to guide him into. Some are good for counſel, others for the execution; ſome for Intrigues and for the Court, others to ſpeak, and other ſome to write. Cloſe han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nature ſeldome drops all her treaſures into one boſome. We muſt therefore ſearch what qualities are born in us, and by them judge of the end whereto ſhe calls us, by the means, and facility ſhe hath given us to attain it. This is ſuch counſel, as cannot be taken till the judgement be ſetled, and mature, and the capacity fully known. It will not be very difficult to get imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fitting his condition, as offices, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, ambaſſages, and other ſuch like, in which he may begin to reduce all his Science into Practice, and make uſe of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:170183:65"/>weapons, or inſtruments his ſtudies ſhall have furniſhed him withal. But at the firſt he will yet need ſome body to enlighten him in all his actions, but in ſuch a manner withal, that he may let his ſpirit work free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it ſelfe, and be content only to fortifie and uphold it: otherwiſe he will never be any other but a Copy, and will be accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ever to rely upon the counſel of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Nay ſometimes it will be good to give him bad counſel, and colour it with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming reaſons, to ſee if he will have the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to penetrate into it, and then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover the falſity of it to him, if he do not perceive it of himſelfe: that ſo he may be always on his guard, and not let himſelfe be eaſily ſurprized, nor truſt ſo much to the opinions, and belief of others, as not to weigh them exactly in the ſcale of his own judgement, and eſteem the real truth, before the falſe friend. That which makes that ſo many Princes have nothing but the title and ornaments of Royalty, proceeds from the faults in their education: For he that
<pb facs="tcp:170183:66"/>hath them in charge, being unwilling that his power ſhould end with their infancy, will be ſure not to open their judgements, and underſtanding too much, leſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming capable enough of themſelves, ſhould not want their help to govern them. The Governor muſt act ſincerely, and lay down his own authority by little and little, according as the other encreaſes in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, letting him act of himſelfe, and only following him cloſe, to be ready to help him if he ſtumble. When one would build an Ark, they ſet up a frame of wood firſt to uphold it, but when it is compleated; that ſupport is taken away, that it may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by its own ſtrength. The ſpirit hath no need of a guide, but then when it is blind: But one muſt not purpoſely leave it in its obſcurity, that we may have occaſion to lead it the longer, nor keep open the wound to have the longer practice. Let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his diſciple ſo well, that he may have the vertue not to forget his care that taught him, and inſpire ſo much goodneſſe as to
<pb facs="tcp:170183:66"/>deſerve and receive a bountiful reward, and let him endeavour as ſpeedily as he can, to change the name of governor into that of domeſtick, and friend. If he prove happy in his conduct, he will gaine more glory, and benefit from the ſecond then the firſt. Let him inſtruct him to conſider the fruit, not the basket, the counſel, not the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, to examine and weigh the ſenſe, the ſubject, and circumſtances of all things; and not oblige himſelfe to any perſons, but according as he finds their fidelity. Let him prove, both the bottom, and to the moſt ſecret receſſes and tortuoſities of the hearts, and affections of thoſe he loves moſt, and let him purge every thing from opinion, and cuſtome. Let him not be too apt, and light to beleeve the good, or evil that is ſaid of any one. Let him try them by the touch-ſtone himſelf, to know the reality, and purity thereof. In fine let him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to himſelfe all the actions, and all the ſentiments, and his friends have no more power, then they ſhall have truth
<pb facs="tcp:170183:67"/>and goodneſs. They may counſel him with artifice if they be wicked, and they may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deceive themſelvs how ſubtile, and clear-ſighted ſoever they be.</p>

But theſe ſhould be alſo accompanied with ſome other Arts, which will be very uſeful inſtruments unto him: As ſome parts of the Mathematicks, that which does not conſiſt altogether in high, and uſeleſs meditations; but which inſtructs the ſenſes, and is appliable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour things for the publick benefit. To learn this, Geometry muſt be the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he muſt know the rules, and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, after Arithmetick, which is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

As for drawing, or painting, if he had any inclination, it would not be amiſs for him to bring his hand to make ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineations, and to draw a plat-form exactly with its dimenſions. For Poetry 'tis an indifferent thing, which does not misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Cavalier, when it is but an acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in him, and an ornament to his other vertues. If he have any Genius to it, it ſhould not be hindered altogether, but he may ſometimes uſe it, it will make him the more able and free to diſcourſe, and will whet his wits: but unleſs he be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of himſelfe to it, I am not of opinion that he ſhould be at all prompted thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are in ſome morenatural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to civil vertue, then in others. Theſe diſpoſitions are of two ſorts: for there are ſuch as ſerve to acquire knowledge: and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb facs="tcp:170183:70"/>Arts, and Sciences with eaſe, and to become prudent, and adviſed in ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and carriage. There are others which ſerve to conform men to moral Vertues. The Latines call the firſt <hi>Ingenium,</hi> and the others <hi>Indolem</hi> and <hi>Ingenuitatem.</hi> The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers call them demy-vertues: vertues are acquired by exerciſe, but theſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and demy-vertues proceed from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of natural diſpoſitions to acquire the vertues of the underſtanding.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe vertues of the underſtanding are Science, Prudence, Art, and other Vertues which ſhall be afterwards menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. We ſee in ſome certain men an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to acquire theſe vertues, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that which is taught them with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, and keep it faithfully: who have much clarity in their diſcourſe, and a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
<pb facs="tcp:170183:70"/>to conjecture: which proceeds from the purity, and ſubtility of the vital and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal ſpirits, and the good conſtitution of the brain. The globularity of the head keeps the ventricles of the brain from being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much preſſed, or crowded, and leaves a more large and free ſpace, or ſhop for the animal ſpirits and imagination to work in. Thoſe whoſe heads are long, and the temples preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inward, have ordinarily defective ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. The climate does alſo contribute; For there are ſome countries where the ſpirits are more lively. The purity of the air we ſuck and breath from our infancy, and the leſſe groſs meats we feed on do alſo help. Moderate melancholy ſerves towards pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: But where choler and gall predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, they are raſh and precipitate. Prompt and fiery ſpirits have ordinarily leaſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like thoſe dogs which being moſt ſwift to run have no ſcent. There are ſome which comprehend a thing quickly, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it immediately, ſemblable to ſoft Wax which eaſily takes any impreſſion, but it is as eaſily put out again.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe ſame diverſity is found in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and inclinations to moral vertues, for there are natures of better tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſome then others, and which are more fit and proper for generous actions. We find ſome men naturally patient under any pains, who endure the wrack without groaning, or ſtarting out into horrid cries. And others that will weep and ſob for the leaſt blow. There are ſome who are reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute amidſt dangers, and others that are ſhook with fear where no cauſe of feare is. Some are not to be moved with injuries, and others take a pigue, or ſnuff for the leaſt occaſion. We find ſome in a conſtant Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citurnity, and others which perpetually babble. There are ſome as hard as pumices, without a drop of pity, and others ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and compaſſionate, their eyes are ever
<pb facs="tcp:170183:71"/>ſhowring down moiſt tears for others mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. Some we ſee are naturally ſober, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ever blowzing in <hi>Bacchus</hi> ſucking bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Yea we find ſome Children have much ing enuity, and deſire of praiſe, coupled with modeſt baſhfulneſſe, and others that are bold and impudent, and full of inſolency.</p>
               <p>Truly inſtruction and examples do help theſe inclinations, but nature and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature contribute alſo mainly. For thoſe that are phlegmatick, and have a ſoft fleſh, their joints not cloſe knit, and narrow che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, are fearful, and quickly ſink under much labour. The cholerick, are haſty and deſperate. The melancholick retain their ſpite and anger a long time. The ſanguine are of gay humors, great eaters, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to luxury.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of Nobility.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>In theſe demy-vertues and good natural diſpoſitions, which are found in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:170183:72"/>more, then in others, conſiſts the natural Nobility. For there are two ſorts of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſs, the one is natural, and the other evil.</p>
               <p>The natural Nobility is that which is called generoſity, by which a man is endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a noble courage, and prompted to great actions, and not only great, but alſo juſt and honeſt, who is handſomely compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of body and mind: who is not aſtoniſht at unexpected accidents, but having a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit above ſuch arreſts, acts with conſtancy and freedom.</p>
               <p>Men that are endued with minds and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies extreamly vigorous, become excellent when they apply themſelves to good; but if for want of <hi>Heroick Education,</hi> and good examples, or falling under the unhappy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of bad Maſters, or having worne out their youthful years in idleneſs, they come to be corrupt and degenerate, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come infinitely wicked, and the vileſt of all men. (The moſt generous Wine turns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the tarteſt Vinegar.) They are moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and inventive, and deſperate to commit
<pb facs="tcp:170183:72"/>baſe and cruel actions, like thoſe grounds which being moſt fertile of themſelves, do but bring forth the moſt poyſonous weeds if they be not manured. <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his young age being bred up amongſt country pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, did not know his own extraction. But every one perceiv'd a natural generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him, by which he ruled over the other village children, and gained much reſpect. The like marks appeared in <hi>Alexanders</hi> greener years, but he corrupted himſelfe afterwards by drunkenneſſe, pride, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. He outſtript his Father <hi>Philip</hi> as well in vices as in vertues. The <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Republick, and that of the <hi>Romans</hi> brought forth many ſuch like ſpirits, nor muſt we doubt but that amongſt the herd of poor people of mean conditions, there are many of excellent natures, whoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty pinnions their courage, and who want nothing but means, and opportunities to raiſe themſelves to an eminent height. All Nations does produce good wits, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring courages, as appears by <hi>Anacharſis</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:170183:73"/>Scythian, and <hi>Democritus</hi> an Abderite. <hi>Sweden</hi> is a country on which the Sun does look aſquint, where every thing ſeems to be frozen, yea, even vertue it ſelf, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it brought forth of late memory a King ſo compleated with Heroick vertues, that he may be oppoſed to thoſe ancient Greeks and Romans, which ſwell ſo many volumes to declare their actions.</p>
               <p>The Civil nobility is that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not purely from the indulgence of Nature, but the extraction of Anceſtors, the ſucceſſe of affairs, and the opinions of men. 'Tis this raiſes the Nobleſs above the peaſantry, which begets Titles, Arms, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies, and the luſtre of their Anceſtors. It took its original from violence, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious raiſing themſelves by conqueſts, and diſarming thoſe that were ſubdued. For in the beginning none but the Nobles were permited to wear a ſword in times of peace. Of which violence we may yet read the Characters in their coats of Arms, which for the moſt part are Lyons, Panthers,
<pb facs="tcp:170183:73"/>Eagles and Griffins: but rarely any Sheep.</p>
               <p>This Civil Nobleſs is a glorious Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it is joined to the natural Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Vertue is more perſpicuous, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary and utile, when it is ſeated in a perſon of an eminent quality: and without doubt to be of an illuſtrious family is no ſmall ſpur to vertue; but it frequently falls to the ſhare of ſuch as are degenerate, weak, of ill-compoſed bodies and minds, who would hardly be received into any employment if they were poor, and of an abject condition. Nothing appears in them but arrogant ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and quarrelſome puntillious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſtanding a tip-to on ſome falſe point of honour, raiſing uproars on imaginary affronts, oft-times ſtaining the reputation of an ancient family by ſome ignoble acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which a peaſant would ſcorn to ſecond him in. 'Tis a reproach to a man to be the firſt Gentleman of his race: but 'tis a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhame to be the laſt. This <hi>Cicero</hi> being of mean birth, rais'd himſelfe to great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by his vertues: But his Son ſoyl'd and
<pb facs="tcp:170183:74"/>loſt all that honour in Taverns. And if the King ſhould ennoble a vitious peaſant it would not change his nature.</p>
               <p>This civil Nobleſſe has great need of riches. Nobility ty'd to poverty is a great burthen: for to maintain their quality and rank they are obliged to great charges, which ſinks them every day deeper into the quagmire of want and poverty: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing more contemptible, in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of theſe days, then a Gentleman that ſpeaks of his race, and brags of his extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet wants bread to eat.</p>
               <p>Now that this ſort of Nobility conſiſts for the moſt part in opinion, appears by this, that he who makes a ſhew of his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy, preſuppoſes that all the Women from whom he deſcends have been honeſt: and likewiſe, becauſe if any one that is not of a noble family, be but eſteemed ſo, he is no leſs honoured then the true ones. And if any one from a low degree do but climb up to the higheſt dignities, and become the chief in a Nation, he ſhall not want the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
<pb facs="tcp:170183:74"/>by which he may draw his original ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the ancient <hi>Scipions,</hi> or what other great fountain he pleaſe. Any flatterer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>This appears alſo becauſe the families riſe, or fall according to the ſucceſſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Alſo, becauſe the cuſtomes, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of people are different thereupon. In the Republick of <hi>Athens</hi> thoſe were the prime and moſt honourable, who had ſuch a certain quantity of wheat annually. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Romans, by <hi>Roſcius</hi> Law, to be a Roman Knight, and have place in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſeats at the Amphitheater, a man muſt have had at leaſt the value of four hundred thouſand Seſterces. In <hi>Italy</hi> the Gentry dwell in the Cities, and are Merchants. In <hi>Spain</hi> they call ſuch a man as wears a ſword,
<pb facs="tcp:170183:75"/>and leads an idle, or a military life, though in great poverty, <hi>Hidalgue.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> to live in the Campania, or Country, ſpend their time in hunting, wear a ſword, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually chained at their ſides, gives one the title of a gentleman. And if a Farmers Son can but ſell his Plow and Farm ſo well as to buy a Barony, he ſhall be called a Baron.</p>
               <p>But, in fine, Earth hath not any thing more glorious, then ancient Nobility, when 'tis found with vertue. (Sayes a learned Engliſh Author) what barbarous mind will not reverence that blood which hath untainted, run thorow ſo large a ſucceſſion of Generations? Beſides, vertue adds a new ſplendor, which together with the honour of his houſe, challengeth a reſpect from all. But bad greatneſs is nothing but the vigor of vice, having both mind and means to be uncontrollably lewd. A debauched ſon of a Noble family, is one of the intollerable butthens of the Earth, and as hateful a thing as Hell: For all know; he hath both exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and precept, flowing in his education;
<pb facs="tcp:170183:75"/>both which are powerful enough, to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate a native illneſſe: yet theſe in him, are but Auxiliaries to his ſhame; that which was the brightneſſe of his Anceſtors, makes his own darknes more palpable. Vice in the Son of an ancient Family, is like a clowniſh Actor in a ſtately Play; he is not only ridiculous in himſelfe, but diſgraces both the Plot and the Poet. Whereas ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in a man of obſcure Parents, is like an unpoliſht Diamond, lying in the way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Pebbles; which howſoever it be neglected of the uncivil vulgar, yet the wiſe lapidary takes it up as a Jewel unvaluable; it being ſo much the more glorious, by how much the other were baſer. He that is good and great, who would not ſell his life to ſerve him nobly: otherwiſe being good, he ſhould be loved better, whoſe Father ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired a Clown; then he that being vitious, is in a lineal deſcent from him, that was Knighted with Tubal-cains Fauchion which he made before the flood.</p>

               <p n="2">2. They muſt be taught as it were play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and encouraged by gifts, and rewards, but rarely by any rude correction. And let thoſe things which are given to others out of neceſſity, be beſtowed upon them as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let them by no means be brought up tenderly, or nouriſhed with delicate and exquiſite meats. Let them not refuſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe or ordinary fare.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their inclinations muſt be warily ſifted, and found out, and by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb facs="tcp:170183:76"/>to any ſtudy contrary to their genius, and inclinations.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They muſt not be over-charged, or toi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with too much exerciſe, or ſtudy; but let them often play, to exerciſe their bodies, and recreate their ſpirits, by unbending and refreſhment. But never let them droop and ruſt in idleneſs. No wine can keep long that had not ſome greenneſſe at the firſt. But age will fix that Mercury.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Too great a herd of condiſciples is hurtful; for beſides that there will be many perverſe ones amongſt them, the Maſter cannot have ſo ſtrickt an eye over them all.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They muſt be ſpurr'd on by emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, praiſing ſome others in their preſence, that has done better then themſelves; this emulation is greateſt amongſt a few. Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtudies ſeldome ſucceed. The ſpirits of children are either benummed, or grow vain and proud by a falſe perſwaſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned.

               <p n="9">9. A too grand ſubjection, makes them ſtart out into debauchments, like wild colts newly broke looſe when they begin to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and taſte their own liberty, and have the elbow room to act their own deſires. They hate thoſe ſtudies that have tormented them. It is therefore good to let them know what liberty is ſometimes, that it may be no new thing to them when they come to command themſelves.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Above all let them be imbued, ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fraighted with uſeful and ſolid lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſtudies, by which they may arrive to the knowledge of God, and to fear and ſerve him, and alſo to know themſelves thorowly. Alſo, thoſe ſtudies which teach them to know and admire the works of the Almighty, and the ſtructure of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. When their judgments are mature, let them be inſtructed in the Ethicks and
<pb facs="tcp:170183:77"/>Politicks: as alſo in Hiſtory, and the ſtate of their own countries. Poetry is an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if natural, but too great a waſter of precious time, if much practiſed, which may be better laid out in more noble im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
